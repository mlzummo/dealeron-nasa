todo:

backend:
-tighter coupling to a shared "Struct Location" which i removed in this demo
-check map bounds 
frontend:
-improved UI look and feel
-look innto using an xterm.js and websocket backend

nice to haves:
Vue Component to render a X,Y plot and position the rovers


have the map have a list of rovers currently plotted on the map (missing for simplicity for now)
